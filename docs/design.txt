Problem Statement:
  We need a program that will check the user's birthday against the current day to decide if the user is over or under 21.  If the user is 21 or over, permit them access to the site.  If they are under 21, take them to a rejection screen. Display their age before redirection. Use select and option tags to get the user input.  The number of days should adapt to the month and whether or not it is a leap year.
  
  Nouns: user's birthday, current day, 21, access, rejection screen, select and option tag
  
  Verbs: check, against, decide, over, under, permit
  
Defining Diagram:
Inputs:
  inputYear
  inputMonth
  inputDate

Processes:
  fill select tag with years
  fill select tag with months
  fill select tag with days
  get currentDate
  get currentMonth
  get currentYear
  read inputYear
  read inputMonth
  read inputDate
  display birthday
  decide if user is over 21
  redirect to welcome page
  OR
  redirect to rejection page

Outputs:
  birthday
  welcome page
  OR
  rejection page

Checking the Solution Algorithm:

VARIABLES: inputYear, inputMonth, inputDate

TEST CASE 1: 

  INPUT VALUES: 1994/9/30 (Check that days stop at thirty)

  EXPECTED RESULT:You entered: 9/30/1994. Welcome. Please wait while you are redirected.

  ACTUAL RESULT:You entered: 9/30/1994. Welcome. Please wait while you are redirected.

TEST CASE 2:

  INPUT VALUES: 1996/12/9 (Just turned 21)

  EXPECTED RESULT: You entered: 12/9/1995. Welcome. Please wait while you are redirected.

  ACTUAL RESULT: You entered: 12/9/1995. Welcome. Please wait while you are redirected.

TEST CASE 3:

  INPUT VALUES: 1996/12/10 (Turns 21 tomorrow)

  EXPECTED RESULT: You entered: 12/10/1996. Access Denied. Please wait while you are redirected.

  ACTUAL RESULT: You entered: 12/10/1996. Access Denied. Please wait while you are redirected.
  
TEST CASE 4:

  INPUT VALUES: 2000/2/29 (leap year)
  
  EXPECTED RESULT: You entered: 2/29/2000. Access Denied. Please wait while you are redirected.

  ACTUAL RESULT: You entered: 2/29/2000. Access Denied. Please wait while you are redirected.

TEST CASE 5:

INPUT VALUES: 1984/1/31 (Check that days stop at 31)

EXPECTED RESULT: You entered: 1/31/1984. Welcome. Please wait while you are redirected.

ACTUAL RESULT: You entered: 1/31/1984. Welcome. Please wait while you are redirected.
